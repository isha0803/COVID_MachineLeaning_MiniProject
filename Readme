Novel Corona Virus Prediction

Before applying various machine learning models on our data, we need to clean it first. 

First, we parse the observation date format of our dataset. As we interpreted that Province attribute has null values so
we need to clean this. 

We replace these null values with NA. We implemented the bar plot for the total
confirmed cases, death cases and recovered to compare their count. 

We plot a line plot for visualizing the trend of how the confirmed cases, death and recoveries change by each passing day.
Now to implement various machine learning models on our data set we divide our dataset for different
purposes. 

We allot 92% of data for training the model, 5% for validation and 3 % for testing the model.

We implement linear regression on training dataset and plot scatter plot with training dataset input
parameters and training output dataset. 

And we plot linear regression line with training input dataset and predicted output. 

We also implement polynomial linear regression on the same dataset and plot the
scatter plot and try to find the best fit linear regression line by adjusting the degree of polynomial. 

We have also calculated various performance evaluation parameters.
